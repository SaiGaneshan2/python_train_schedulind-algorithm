Let's consider a classic problem that can be approached using both *Greedy* and *Divide and Conquer* strategies:  

## *Problem: Minimum Number of Platforms*  
Given arrival and departure times of trains at a railway station, determine the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits due to lack of platform availability.

### *Approach 1: Greedy Algorithm*  
*Algorithm:*
1. Sort the arrival and departure times.
2. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to track active platforms.
3. Iterate through the sorted arrival times:
   - If the next train arrives before the earliest departure in the heap, allocate a new platform.
   - Otherwise, free up the platform before allocating it.
4. Maintain the maximum number of platforms used at any point.

*Time Complexity:*  
- Sorting arrivals and departures: \( O(N \log N) \)  
- Iterating through the events: \( O(N \log N) \) (heap operations)  
- *Total: \( O(N \log N) \)*

### *Approach 2: Divide and Conquer*  
*Algorithm:*
1. Divide the train schedules into two halves.
2. Recursively find the required platforms for each half.
3. Merge results to compute the minimum platforms needed when both halves are considered together.
4. During merging, process events in sorted order, updating platform usage dynamically.

*Time Complexity:*  
- Dividing takes \( O(\log N) \) recursive calls.  
- Merging arrival and departure schedules takes \( O(N) \) per step.  
- *Total: \( O(N \log N) \)*

### *Comparison of the Two Approaches*  
| Factor            | Greedy Approach | Divide & Conquer |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Time Complexity  | \( O(N \log N) \) | \( O(N \log N) \) |
| Space Complexity | \( O(N) \) (heap) | \( O(N) \) (recursion) |
| Simplicity       | Easier to implement | More structured for parallelization |

---

#### *Conclusion:*  
- The *Greedy approach* is more intuitive and direct. It efficiently keeps track of platform usage with a priority queue.  
- The *Divide and Conquer approach* can be useful when handling large datasets where parallel processing is beneficial.  
- Both approaches have similar time complexity, but *Greedy is typically preferred due to its simpler implementation.*
